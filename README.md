Discogs Explorer

This tool allows you to explore discogs in a faster way. As of now it generate youtube playlist and google search links from seller catalogs, artist and record label catalogs, per page.

Install:
Copy the content of discogs.bookmark.js and create a new bookmark in your browser (works nicer in firefox) with that as the address. Name it "dgexplorer".

Usage:
Visit your favorite discogs seller, artist or label, and while looking at the catalog press your new bookmark button. Expect to be amazed.

Problems to solve:
* A release could be missed if its embedded video doesn't exist anymore. Such broken video will be added to the playlist and we won't be able to tell which release it is from.
* For a release with embedded videos, any track that has no video on that embedded playlist would be missed and there is no way to know about it.
* Version mismatch as in discogs.
* Repetition of videos if releases in catalog are repeated but in different pages.
* Filter sections on Artist pages just show/hide content. For artists with a big catalog, you may want to get only what you see, but it will give you the same result as without filters.

Enjoy the ride.
